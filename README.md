# PHP Cheat Sheet

This project is part of the exercises done on the last refresh marathon of the PHP programming language. All exercises were coded along with this cheat sheet file. Please notice this is not a full and complete reference on the language (for that, refer to a book or something like that). This is just a quick reference on the language.
